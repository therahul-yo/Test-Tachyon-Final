        comment: "✅ USER TASK ISOLATION TEST PASSED - Comprehensive testing completed successfully. All 9 test steps executed: 1) User1 signup ✅ 2) User1 task creation ✅ 3) User1 logout ✅ 4) User2 signup ✅ 5) User2 cannot see User1's task ✅ 6) User2 task creation ✅ 7) User2 logout ✅ 8) User1 login ✅ 9) User1 sees only own task ✅. Task isolation working perfectly - users can only see their own tasks. Minor: Socket.io CORS errors detected but do not affect core functionality."
